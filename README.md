This platform enables solar energy Prosumers(producer+consumer) to trade the surplus solar energy exported to their provider.

Prosumers will create an EEC(Energy Export Contract) which will have thier name, consumer no, provider, region and amount of electricity(KWH).
This EEC can be sold to other prosumer on the platform.

Our initially assumption was that all the governmental and private providers will come to an agreement and the EEC trades can be done efficiently.
But why would provider take a loss? Was the question.
So we decided to add a small EEC conversion fee, every time Exported energy is converted to contract by producer, or vice versa by consumer.
This fee will make up for providers loss, and prosumers can trade and earn price differences, creating a win-win situation.
